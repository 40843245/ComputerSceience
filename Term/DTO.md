# DTO (Data Transfer Object)

The book "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" in amazon 

The first part is a short (100 page) tutorial on enterprise application architecture. The bulk of the book is the reference to forty or so patterns. All of these patterns are ones that I've seen in the field, usually on many different programming platforms.
